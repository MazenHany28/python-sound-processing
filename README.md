# python-sound-processing
Python program with simple interface that takes .wav sound files
Do some signal operations like:
1) time shifting (delay)
2) time scaling (controlling speed)
3) reflecting (playing backwards)
4) amplitude scaling (controlling volume) 
5) plotting the signal waveform of original versus modified sound files.
6) saving the modified .wav sound file
