1) Download rubberband library (folder containing rubberband.exe and libsndfile-1.dll) ======> rubberband-2.0.2-gpl-executable-windows
2) Go to Windows System Environment and Add the folder to Path.
3) Create System Variable with Variable name "rubberband" and path to the rubberband.exe
4) Make sure all your relevant users can access the path and the rubberband variable 
(for me, I had to set it up for the admin account and my local user account).
This can be checked by opening cmd and typing "rubberband". If the command works, the library is recognized.
5) Restart the Program in which you want to access the library (e.g. restart Visual Studio).
